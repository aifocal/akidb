✅ HN launch strategy (title, post, FAQs)
✅ Email campaign (3 templates, 50 leads)
✅ LinkedIn content (3 post types)
✅ Twitter thread (10 tweets)

⚠️ Stripe billing integration
⚠️ Analytics tracking (Segment/Mixpanel)
⚠️ Email automation (Mailgun)

### Missing Dependencies

**Blockers for Launch:**
1. **SDK availability** - Developers need PyPI/npm packages

## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
✅ Comprehensive content suite completed in single day
✅ Multi-channel strategy (HN, email, social, community)
✅ Pre-written FAQ responses save time during launch
✅ UTM tracking planned for attribution
✅ Influencer outreach identified high-value targets

### What Could Be Improved
⚠️ Infrastructure tasks should have been prioritized earlier
⚠️ SDK publishing is a hard blocker for developer signups
⚠️ Demo environment needs to be live before blog post
⚠️ Analytics setup should precede content launch

### Recommendations for Day 3
1. **All hands on infrastructure** (SDK, demo, billing)
2. **Test end-to-end signup flow** (Free → Startup upgrade)
3. **Load test demo environment** (1,000 concurrent users)
4. **Don't launch Product Hunt without infrastructure** (high bounce rate)
