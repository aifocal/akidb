# Quantum Error Correction

## Overview

Design and analyze quantum error-correcting codes, including surface codes and
fault-tolerant logical operations, while applying error mitigation techniques
to bridge current hardware limitations.

## Core Concepts & Best Practices

- **Code Families**: Evaluate stabilizer, surface, color, and LDPC codes; match
  code distance and threshold to hardware constraints.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Implement transversal gates, lattice surgery, and magic
  state distillation while tracking logical error budgets.
- **Syndrome Extraction**: Optimize measurement circuits to minimize hook
  errors and leakage; schedule parallelism carefully.
- **Decoding Strategies**: Apply minimum-weight perfect matching, belief
  propagation, or neural decoders; benchmark latency versus accuracy.
- **Error Mitigation**: Combine post-selection, probabilistic error
  cancellation, and Clifford data regression with error correction for
  near-term devices.

## Tools & Methodologies

- **Simulation Frameworks**: Use Qiskit Ignis, QEC frameworks, Stim, or LDPC
  simulation libraries to evaluate logical error rates.
- **Decoder Implementations**: Integrate PyMatching, tensor network decoders,
  or custom FPGA-based solutions for real-time performance.
- **Threshold Analysis**: Perform Monte Carlo sampling over noise channels
  (Pauli, amplitude damping, biased dephasing) to estimate thresholds.
- **Logical Circuit Compilation**: Map high-level algorithms onto logical
  qubits, schedule patch moves, and analyze lattice surgery costs.
- **Cross-Layer Co-Design**: Coordinate hardware calibration teams with QEC
  architects to ensure stabilizer measurements align with physical gate
  capabilities.

## Example Scenario

A quantum computing platform targets a 10⁻³ logical error rate. Engineers
select rotated surface codes with distance nine, implement syndrome extraction
sequences with tailored CNOT ordering, and deploy PyMatching for decoding.
Post-implementation Monte Carlo runs confirm the logical failure rate meets
the reliability target under measured device noise.
