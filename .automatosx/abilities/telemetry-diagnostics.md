# Telemetry Diagnostics

## Overview

Develop telemetry analysis pipelines for spacecraft health monitoring, anomaly
detection, and root-cause investigation to maintain mission safety and
performance.

## Core Concepts & Best Practices

- **Telemetry Architecture**: Define packet structures, sampling cadences, and
  data routing between on-board computers, ground stations, and archives.
- **Signal Conditioning**: Calibrate sensor data, apply filtering (e.g., Kalman,
  Savitzky-Golay), and manage quantization or time skew.
- **Anomaly Detection**: Use rule-based thresholds, state estimation
  residuals, and machine learning classifiers (e.g., autoencoders, Bayesian
  models).
- **Fault Isolation**: Correlate cross-subsystem data, maintain fault trees,
  and perform change point analysis to localize issues quickly.
- **Operational Resilience**: Establish alert prioritization, escalation
  paths, and simulation back-testing for flight director readiness.

## Tools & Methodologies

- **Data Platforms**: Deploy time-series databases (InfluxDB, TimescaleDB) with
  visualization tools (Grafana, Jupyter) for rapid insight.
- **Processing Pipelines**: Implement streaming analytics with Apache
  Flink/Spark or cloud-native services; ensure deterministic reprocessing.
- **Model Libraries**: Utilize Python packages (scikit-learn, PyOD), MATLAB
  toolboxes, or NASA VIPER for anomaly analytics.
- **Playback & Simulation**: Reconstruct telemetry scenarios with digital twins
  or hardware-in-the-loop setups to validate hypotheses.
- **Configuration Management**: Version-control telemetry definitions, limit
  changes via configuration control boards, and audit ground software.

## Example Scenario

During a LEO mission, battery temperature sensors report sporadic spikes.
Engineers run residual analysis against thermal models, replay telemetry
through a digital twin, and identify a degraded radiator valve actuator. A
coordinated response adjusts heater duty cycle to maintain safe limits while
planning hardware replacement.
