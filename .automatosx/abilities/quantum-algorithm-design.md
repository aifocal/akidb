# Quantum Algorithm Design

## Overview

Architect and tailor quantum algorithms such as QAOA, VQE, phase estimation,
Grover, and Shor to solve optimization, simulation, and search problems while
balancing gate depth, noise resilience, and classical-quantum workflow
integration.

## Core Concepts & Best Practices

- **Problem Mapping**: Encode cost Hamiltonians or oracle functions that capture
  the classical objective while minimizing qubit requirements.
- **Ansatz Engineering**: Choose hardware-efficient or problem-inspired
  ansätze; analyze expressibility versus trainability to avoid barren plateaus.
- **Hybrid Loops**: Couple classical optimizers (e.g., SPSA, COBYLA, Adam) with
  quantum evaluations; reuse measurement data with parameter-shift gradients
  where available.
- **Resource Estimation**: Quantify logical depth, T-count, and qubit footprint
  prior to execution; evaluate circuit cut options for limited hardware.
- **Error Mitigation**: Integrate zero-noise extrapolation, symmetry
  verification, and probabilistic error cancellation early in algorithm design.

## Tools & Methodologies

- **Algorithm Templates**: Start from QAOA/VQE scaffolds and customize mixers,
  cost layers, and measurement strategies.
- **Classical Preprocessing**: Leverage problem reductions, graph
  sparsification, or symmetry analysis to shrink the search space.
- **Parameter Initialization**: Apply warm-start heuristics (e.g., classical
  solutions, layer-wise training) to accelerate convergence.
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Run simulators with realistic noise models and
  track expected energy, fidelity, or success probability across layer depths.
- **Result Verification**: Validate solutions against classical solvers (exact
  or approximate) and quantify quantum advantage via scaling studies.

## Example Scenario

A logistics team models vehicle routing as a constrained optimization problem.
By formulating the cost Hamiltonian for QAOA, selecting a tailored mixer that
respects route feasibility, and combining SPSA with layer-wise parameter
growth, they achieve improved approximation ratios on a noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device relative to classical heuristics.
